**Important:** The default (`main`) branch is a beta version of the next release. It contains the latest fixes, new labels and changes to application labels, but they are also not thoroughly tested yet. Installomator is designed so that changes to application labels should not affect the behavior of the script outside of that label, so it should be mostly safe, but things may be in flux. If you want the latest release version, you can either switch to the [`release` branch](https://github.com/Installomator/Installomator/tree/release) from the branch menu above the file list (where is says 'main' by default) or download the Installomator latest, non-beta, zip from the ['Releases'](https://github.com/Installomator/Installomator/releases) area and extract Installomator.sh. [More detail on the wiki.](https://github.com/Installomator/Installomator/wiki/Branches-and-Betas)

**Always test carefully and thoroughly in your environment before going to production!**

*Every production and deployment environment is different: please test thoroughly before rolling it out to your production.*

We have put a lot of work into making it stable and safe, but we _cannot_ and will not make _any_ promises that it won't break in some not yet encountered edge case.
