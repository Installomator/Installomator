**Installomator log**
**At the bottom of this report**, provide a log, either by running Installomator in Terminal and saving the output, or by downloading the result log from your MDM. [Debug logging level](https://github.com/Installomator/Installomator/wiki/Configuration-and-Variables#logging-level) is not needed for easily identified issues, like a `downloadURL` is blank or an `appNewVersion` is incorrect. *PLEASE format the log [using a code block](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#fenced-code-blocks)!*
