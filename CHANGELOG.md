## v0.5 - 2020-

- when Installomator cannot find an app in a dmg with the given appName it will now use the first .app in the root dir. This is for applications which contain the version number in the application name. Note: this might lead to multiple versions of the app in the /Applications directory. You will have to find a different means to clean these up when necessary

- you can now set script variables as an argument in the form `VARIABLE=value`. More detail on this in the README file, 'Configuration from Arguments.' (#26, #50, #72, and #73)
- change `downloadFromGit` to match file types better (#58)
- implemented a workaround for changed behavior of `xpath` in Big Sur (#80)
- added an option `prompt_user_then_kill` to `BLOCKING_PROCESS_ACTION` which will kill the process after the third unsuccessful attempt to quit (#78, thanks Patrick Atoon @raptor399)
- added several new labels for total of 116
